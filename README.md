# Prediction-of-runs-in-an-Inning
This project is based on the official dataset of IPL and contains detailed information of each inning from 2008 to 2020. In this project we have work on multiple datasets and did data cleaning and feature engineering to get required feature in our final training dataset. Then using  pipeline we have perform Linear Regression, Decision Tree, RF regressor, SVM then GridSearch to get best parameters and based on this RF regressor was our best model and performed Cross-validation then We have tested this model for prediction of single match and successfully visualize the actual and predicted runs scored by  batsman in an inning. This model is useful for many sport analyst as well as team building.
